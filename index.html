            <p>Hello! I’m David Alsabrook—husband, father of four, and someone who thrives on setting goals and surpassing them. Right
            now, I'm fully immersed in <a href="#aicurb" style='color: rgb(255, 168, 86);'>AICurbAppeal.com</a>, a project where I’m exploring AI-driven image editing for
            homeowners and property owners. My path began in business management, but now I’m fully focused on tech, especially in
            areas like AI integration and building VPS and serverless applications.
            <br/><br/>
            What really drives me is finding the perfect tech for each new project. I’m motivated by the energy of working together in a cross-functional team to
            set and accomplish big goals and create products we can be proud of. Each project pushes my skills further, and I can’t
            wait to see what’s next.</p>

                  changes by visualizing updates before committing. The project has been a rewarding challenge so far as
                  my first major venture with Next.js. From integrating multiple AI APIs
                  and managing NoSQL databases to handling Stripe payments, it has pushed me to learn new technologies
                  and how to interconnect them to all work together.</p>

                The TuBros website was my first freelance project and a test of how quickly I could get a polished site launched. I
                wanted scalable React components and a future-proof build, so I chose Next.js for its server-side rendering and built-in
                image optimization. The client was non-technical and didn’t have specific goals for content or design, which gave me
                creative freedom. For the contact section, he requested SMS over email, so I had to figure out how to send SMS directly
                from the front end. Learning to integrate third-party tools with Cloudflare Workers to handle SMS was a valuable lesson
                in practical problem-solving.

                  <p>The client’s only design input was a business card with a black background and decorative scrollwork beneath the logo,
                  which he wanted the website to reflect. I used this as a foundation, building the site’s look and feel around that card,
                  starting with the hero section and expanding from there.</p>

                  <p>Keeping the design straightforward was essential for delivering the info users would need—without any fluff. The focus

                <h3>Copaneazi's Pizzeria</h3>
                <p><em>CMS, CSS</em></p>

                <p>While it might seem unconventional to include a CMS site in the projects section of a developer
                  portfolio, I
                  wanted to
                  highlight the various skills involved in building a website. This project allowed me to dive into
                  several aspects,
                  such
                  as creating images in Photoshop, photographing products, and gathering information that the client
                  wanted
                  displayed—like
                  current menu items and pricing. I also focused on integrating their ordering system and optimizing for
                  SEO.

                  Working with clients whose entire livelihood revolves around the business we’re building the site for
                  can be
                  intense,
                  but I found it incredibly engaging and collaborative. I loved taking their ideas and adding my unique
                  twists to
                  bring
                  the project to life.</p>

                  <p>Getting the right image for the hero section was essential for capturing users' interest. It was
                    also important
                    to
                    include what 90% of people are looking for right away. The client wanted users to be able to
                    immediately call or
                    place
                    an order.</p>

                  <p>Given that this restaurant currently operates two locations, it was important for the client to
                    emphasize the
                    various
                    methods available for contacting each location, making this a key focus of the project.</p>

                  <p>It was important to me to present their product in an engaging and playful manner that truly makes
                    it stand out
                    and pop
                    off the page. Utilizing the widely popular "masonry" layout effectively contributes to achieving
                    that vibrant
                    and
                    dynamic feeling.</p>

                  <p>The client had an image that perfectly captures their fun attitude and emphasizes that the business
                    is locally owned by an individual, not a national corporation. I enjoyed taking
                    their image, editing it, and incorporating it at the bottom of every page to maintain a cohesive look.</p>
                </div>
                <p>As I mentioned, this site was built using a low-code platform, where my main focus was on custom CSS.
                This project underscores the crucial role of gathering and creating images that align with the client's vision and
                overall feel. It's vital for a developer to consider elements like achieving the right atmosphere, ensuring smooth
                navigation, optimizing for SEO, and effectively showcasing products—all essential tools in their toolkit.</p>

                <p>The Synth Website was an end of trimester project focused on front-end technologies, where my partner
                  and I explored 3D design. The site places users in a cabin with a functional synthesizer on a table,
                  overlooking a mountain landscape. Users can create and loop synth sequences alongside a drum pad with instruments like kick
                  drum, hi-hat, and snare. A dropdown menu lets users modify the outdoor scene, adding snow or rain and switching from daylight to
                  an amber evening.</p>

                    dial-up, I’m thrilled with how the site turned out. The unique challenges pushed us to think creatively.

                  three days, and figuring out how to use a raycaster for interaction, was definitely loading times. We initially faced
                  load times of around five minutes, but through extensive compression and utilizing tools like Draco Loader, we’ve
                  managed to bring those times down to about 45 seconds, depending on internet speeds. It was a major focus of the

                  <p>For the small amount of actual HTML and CSS we implemented for this project, I designed and built a dropdown menu that

                  and load pre-made music for the synth. To enhance the user experience, we also managed to remember user settings using
                  cookies and local storage..

                  The shell provides a user interface that allows you to interact with the operating system by entering commands, which
                  the system interprets and executes. In most operating systems, a shell (like Bash, Zsh, or the Windows Command Prompt)
                  is the primary CLI used to run programs, manage files, and perform other system tasks.

                  variable to provide users with command-line access for opening, editing, and manipulating files at a system level gave
                  me strong fundamentals for handling core processes.

                  parsing them to determine variable types and formatting requirements before outputting. Implementing this taught me how
                  functions manage variable arguments and memory allocation, reinforcing the importance of precision when working at the
                  system level.

                of a given design, and one demonstrating my backend deployment skills. I’m adding this project to highlight the

                  <p>My main goal with this site was to replicate the default VSCode design with pinpoint precision. I matched all hex codes
                  for colors, added icons to mimic the “files” layout, and created a working tab system that’s fully integrated with the
                  “file explorer” on the side.

              <p>At this school, we explore various facets of computer science through classes on data structures, algorithms, and time
              complexity. After completing the foundational computer science courses, we transition into our specializations; mine is
              full stack development. Our specialization classes are structured to emphasize different aspects of engineering,
              starting with comprehensive full stack training. From there, we dive into the intricacies of front-end development,
              followed by a focus on back-end technologies. Finally, we wrap up our training with extensive work on modern
              technologies, particularly in component-based programming.
